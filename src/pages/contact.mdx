<h1 className="mb-4 text-3xl font-medium">Contact me</h1>

You can get in touch with me by opening the nearest window and yelling out of it real loud.

<h2 className="mt-5 text-xl font-medium">Or you can wave to me</h2>
<p className="mt-2">Just click this button to simulate a friendly wave.</p>
<Wave className="mt-4" />
<p className="mt-4">
  Please note that I may not wave back. This is because I am very far away and
  probably didn't see you click this button.
